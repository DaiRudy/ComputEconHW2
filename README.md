# Homework 2: MIT Shock and Krusellâ€“Smith Model

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts related to solving and simulating baseline and MIT shocks in heterogeneous agent models. The models include Aiyagari-style setups and Krusellâ€“Smith models.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Overview

| File Name              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `HW2.1`                | Baseline Aiyagari model. |
| `HW2.1.4`              | Extension of HW2.1 with an additional bonus part (part 4). |
| `HW2.2`                | Baseline KS model.  |
| `HW2.2.4`              | Bonus part for HW2.2 (part 4)). |
| `HW2.3.AM`             | MIT shock in an Aiyagari model (AM), solving forward in time. |
| `HW2.3.AMBackward`     | A backward iteration version of the AM model.  |
| `HW2.3.KS`             | MIT shock in the Krusellâ€“Smith model. |
| `HW2.3.KSBackward`     | Reverse iteration for the KS model, showing divergence from forward solution. |
| `HW2.3.KS-New`         | Updated with more precise K path, but still not trustworthy |
| `HW2.3.KSBackward-New` | Updated with more precise K path and reverse iteration, but still not trustworthy |
| `HW2.3.Time`           | Timing comparison script â€” benchmarks execution time of KS vs AM models for question 3. |
